<blockquote> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I have had an experience of leading a research group for 2 semesters during my senior high school days.<sup>1</sup> The research I led was successful so I think I have <strong>leadership skills</strong>.<sup>2</sup> Though at the start it’s a challenge for me, I successfully managed to get my group to pass our subjects.<sup>3</sup> <strong>Attention to detail</strong> is one of my skills that I keep on improving as making a mistake can be expensive or what causes something to fail.<sup>4</sup> I have <strong>software proficiency</strong>, I know how to use different productivity applications like Word and PowerPoint.<sup>5</sup> I have knowledge in some of the programming languages like Python, Java, and C#.<sup>6</sup> I like to be <strong>organized</strong>.<sup>7</sup> One of the few things I can boast about is how organized the things in my computer are and everything that I own in our house.<sup>8</sup> All are put in their own folders and specified to the details.<sup>9</sup> I’m <strong>open minded</strong>, in the sense that I take other people's suggestions, opinions, comments towards me or my work.<sup>10</sup> I would like to think that their suggestion would help me improve more.<sup>11</sup> </blockquote>

<blockquote> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ever since my junior high years, I have been interested in <strong>accounting</strong> when the subject we had for our <abbr title="Technology and Livelihood Education">TLE</abbr> is <abbr title="Accountancy, Business, and Management">ABM</abbr>.<sup>1</sup> It seems so fun balancing the credit and debit side of the accounting journal.<sup>2</sup> What made it more interesting is our teacher, she has this way of teaching that makes sure that everyone in the room is interested in the lesson.<sup>3</sup> You know in our family, I was painted as the person who doesn’t know anything in the house but little did they know I had been <strong>cooking</strong> for myself when they were not at home.<sup>4</sup> You can say that I don’t want them to know that I like cooking because I don’t want them to make me cook for them.<sup>5</sup> Ever since the start of my senior high school years, I've been playing this <abbr title="multiplayer online battle arena"><strong>MOBA</strong></abbr> game.<sup>6</sup> I’ve dreamed of being a pro player but I guess that’s not in the table for now as it’s risky for me to go out there since it won’t be guaranteed that I get to compete in the professional league.<sup>7</sup> What I do in my free time is, I try to play with my friends and reach the highest rank possible.<sup>8</sup> Before the academic year started I aimed to be one of the global players in the world and I’ve reached like 1050<sup>th</sup> over an active 50 million players.<sup>9</sup> I would say that was not bad considering I only had a month to grind.<sup>10</sup></blockquote>
