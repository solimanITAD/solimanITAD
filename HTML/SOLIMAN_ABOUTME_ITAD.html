	<blockquote>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As a child, all I did was play, eat, and sleep.<sup>1</sup> One of the fondest memories of my childhood was whenever it was Christmas time.<sup>2</sup> My parents will always buy me a present and I would always pick a toy car, whether it’s a remote controlled one or just a plain car toy.<sup>3</sup> I remember being obsessed with toys especially when it’s car related.<sup>4</sup> I actually still keep some of the toys that my parents gave me back then cause it holds so much memory to me.<sup>5</sup> One of the happy car-related memories I had when I was a child was when my cousin who came from the province visited me.<sup>6</sup> Her sister bought him a remote controlled car and we competed with each other to see which car is the fastest between the two.<sup>7</sup> He actually won as I discovered that it actually depends on what battery the car is using when I took a look at the battery of his car, his sister bought him the energizer battery while I use eveready.<sup>8</sup> When I was a kindergarten student, I almost didn’t make it to Grade 1 because of my age.<sup>9</sup> I started school early only when I was 4 years old.<sup>10</sup> Back in the day, that was early already.<sup>11</sup> The deciding factor for me to be able to pass kindergarten was I should be able to read words.<sup>12</sup> Thankfully I passed with <q>flying colors</q> as my mother would say.<sup>13</sup> During my elementary days, I can say that I almost participated in all of the activities.<sup>14</sup> There was a funny story when I was a Grade 1 student.<sup>15</sup> In public schools when a teacher is absent, the class that she was an adviser to gets transferred to another section temporarily for the whole day.<sup>16</sup> One time, my adviser was absent, my classmates and I got separated into another section.<sup>17</sup> You wanna know what the funny part is? Me and one of my classmates snuck out and just stayed outside of the rooms.<sup>18</sup> The reason why I snuck out was because I will get transferred to a teacher that I was really scared of.<sup>19</sup> I remember crying and crying until a teacher noticed us.<sup>20</sup> She decided to call my mother who immediately fetched me and we just went home for the day.<sup>21</sup></blockquote>

	<blockquote> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp High school was where life got more serious to me, academically.<sup>1</sup> Another story worth telling and I would say if this incident didn’t happen I won’t be standing here today.<sup>2</sup> So the story begins with my aunt enrolling me for Grade 7.<sup>3</sup> My mother asked my aunt to enroll me since we will be out of town during the enrollment day.<sup>4</sup> We went to Iloilo to visit my mother’s family.<sup>5</sup> During that time I was so excited because I got to ride an airplane on the way there.<sup>6</sup> I’m not gonna lie, I was nervous at that time since I don’t know how it feels and I’ve seen the movie 2012 which kind of traumatized me.<sup>7</sup> What I liked the most when we were there was the freshness of the air.<sup>8</sup> The lack of signal was also a good break from social media.<sup>9</sup> When we want to get a signal, we need to get to the highest part of the place.<sup>10</sup> While we we’re having fun enjoying our vacation, our aunt suddenly texted and told my mother that I was needed in the enrollment since there was an interview to be conducted.<sup>11</sup> My mother was confused about it since my sisters who are also currently enrolled didn’t go through the enrollment process.<sup>12</sup> As a result of that our vacation has come to an end for only a week. On our way home we took a <abbr title ="roll on roll off ferry"><emp>RORO</emp></abbr> which took almost 2 days compared to the airplane which only took at least 1-2 hours.<sup>13</sup> As we got home, we found out that my aunt enrolled me in a section that specializes in <abbr title ="science, technology, engineering and mathematics">STEM</abbr>.<sup>14</sup> If I haven’t mentioned yet I went to Rizal High School in Pasig City which has been listed as the <em>largest secondary school in the world</em> since 1993 by the <strong>Guinness Book of World Records</strong> until 2005 .<sup>15</sup> Each year there consists of like 30+ sections and my aunt enrolled me in <abbr title ="science, technology, engineering and mathematics">STEM</abbr>.<sup>16</sup> Thankfully I passed the grade requirements but sadly, in the interview I failed.<sup>17</sup> At the end of the day, I got put in the pilot section.<sup>18</sup> As the school year began, I was pushing myself to do good in every aspect of life.<sup>19</sup> I was shocked after our 1st grading. I was included in the Top 10 of the class.<sup>20</sup> Little did I know that small decision that my aunt did, made a big impact in my life.<sup>21</sup> I can proudly say that I was always included in the top of my class.<sup>22</sup> Sadly, she passed away a few years ago and she will always have a special place in my heart as the person who believed in me no matter what.<sup>23</sup></blockquote>

	<blockquote> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I would say that college is the most challenging part of my life.<sup>1</sup> When I was supposed to graduate, the pandemic happened which caused everything to be canceled.<sup>2</sup> The work of my father was affected too.<sup>3</sup> Because of my father having no work, me and my sibling had to stop our college journey temporarily.<sup>4</sup> The pandemic taught me to be strong, as it challenged me mentally.<sup>5</sup> It was like one hell of a ride.<sup>6</sup> I was all over the place and I didn’t know what to do.<sup>7</sup> I even tried to apply for a job but my parents won’t let me since they are scared I’ll get the virus.<sup>8</sup> I understand them but I wanted to save money so I can have money for my tuition fee.<sup>9</sup> I would say that I was not doing great mentally that time.<sup>10</sup> There was a time I just cried and I was scared to talk to anyone.<sup>11</sup> As I tried to break free from that mental state, I just decided to talk to my old friends which helped me.<sup>12</sup> I also tried to learn piano and the dizi flute that time.<sup>13</sup> I would say that It was hard and I just gave up.<sup>14</sup> It’s hard in the sense that I don’t have the proper equipment to practice on I only had the app in the phone while the flute broke days after it arrived.<sup>15</sup> I had 2 classmates during my senior year who also stopped for the meantime and we just talked to each other about our future plans.<sup>16</sup> I got much closer to one of them as we almost talked to each other everyday and played online together.<sup>17</sup> Currently, the three of us are in the same section and our bond just keeps on getting stronger.<sup>18</sup> Flashback during our first year of college, I was having a hard time because my computer sucks and our laptop overheats easily.<sup>19</sup> My mom even tried to borrow a laptop from her friend but it has a hard drive problem so I wasn’t able to use it.<sup>20</sup> I was shy about requesting a laptop because I’m worried about our finances.<sup>21</sup> I overcame this thing and just asked my father and he said that he has put aside some money just in case we needed something and after that I got to buy a laptop and I don’t need to worry about the lag.<sup>22</sup> Currently, I'm on my 2nd year of college and adjusting to the new face-to-face protocol.<sup>23</sup></blockquote>
